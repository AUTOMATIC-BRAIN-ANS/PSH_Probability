## Description

In this repository, we proposed an integrative approach to modeling Paroxysmal Sympathetic Risk (PSH) risk during the early period after Traumatic Brain Injury by analyzing time evolution of autonomic nervous system (ANS) metrics and their relationship with intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebrovascular reactivity within the first 72 hours.
